# Day 91: Funny, Eh? Funny, How? üòÇ  

The **API** we're using today is the fantastic [JokeAPI](https://jokeapi.dev), which offers jokes in categories like programming, general, and dark humor. With advanced filtering and response customization, it's a great way to learn API integration while adding a touch of humor. üòÑ  

This tutorial is adjusted for **VSCode**, so make sure you're running it using the command:  
```python
python3 python_files/day91.py
```

### üëâ Get a Random Joke  

Here's how to fetch a random programming joke from the API and display it. The API provides jokes in JSON format, and you can request specific categories or types (single-line or two-part jokes).  

```python
import requests, json

# Fetch a random programming joke
url = "https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming"
response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    joke_data = response.json()
    
    # Print the entire response nicely formatted
    print(json.dumps(joke_data, indent=2))
else:
    print(f"Error: Unable to fetch jokes. Status code {response.status_code}")
```

### üëâ Display Only the Joke üé≠  

If you only want to display the joke, update the code as follows:  

```python
import requests, json

# Fetch a random programming joke
url = "https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming"
response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    joke_data = response.json()

    # Check if it's a single-line or two-part joke
    if joke_data["type"] == "single":
        print(joke_data["joke"])  # Output single-line joke
    else:
        print(f"{joke_data['setup']} - {joke_data['delivery']}")  # Output two-part joke

else:
    print(f"Error: Unable to fetch jokes. Status code {response.status_code}")
```

## Why This API is Great for Learning  

The **JokeAPI** is an excellent tool for learning about API integration because:  

1. **Customizable Categories**: Choose jokes from categories like programming, general, or pun.  
2. **Multiple Formats**: Request jokes as single-line or two-part for variety.  
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Exclude certain categories or flags for tailored results.  
4. **Educational Documentation**: Comprehensive examples make it easy to get started.  

Explore more possibilities in the [JokeAPI documentation](https://jokeapi.dev/documentation). Have fun coding with humor! üéâ

# Day 91 Challenge: Your Personalized Joke Vault! üé≠ü§£  

Today‚Äôs challenge takes humor to the next level by building a **personalized joke-saving program**! This program will let you:  

1. **Fetch a Random Joke**: Get a fresh dose of humor on-demand.  
2. **Save Your Favorites**: Decide which jokes are worth keeping for later laughs.  
3. **View Your Saved Jokes**: Build and display your personal joke collection.  

Let‚Äôs turn laughter into a fun and interactive coding experience! üöÄ  

---

## üìù **Challenge Requirements**  

Here‚Äôs what your program should do step-by-step:  

1. **Fetch a Random Joke**:  
   - Use the [JokeAPI](https://jokeapi.dev) to get a random joke.  
   - Display the joke to the user.  

2. **Save Jokes by Choice**:  
   - Ask the user if they want to save the joke.  
   - If they say yes, store the joke's **ID number** and content in a local Python dictionary.  

3. **View Saved Jokes**:  
   - Ask the user if they‚Äôd like to see their saved jokes.  
   - If yes, display all the jokes saved in the dictionary, formatted nicely.  

---

## üöÄ **Stretch Goals (Optional)**  

1. **Filter by Joke Category**:  
   Allow users to specify the category of jokes they want (e.g., programming, pun, etc.).  

2. **Add a Search Feature**:  
   Let users search for saved jokes by keywords in the setup or delivery.  

3. **Save Data Persistently**:  
   Store the saved jokes in a file (e.g., `saved_jokes.json`) so they persist across program runs.  

4. **Remove Jokes**:  
   Add functionality to delete jokes from the saved list.  

---

## üí° **Implementation Hints**  

1. **Fetching the Joke**:  
   Use the API endpoint to get a random joke:  
   ```python
   https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any
   ```

2. **Dynamic User Input**:  
   Use `input()` to interact with the user for saving jokes and displaying saved ones.  

3. **Saving Jokes**:  
   Use a Python dictionary to store jokes with their IDs as keys:  
   ```python
   saved_jokes = {}
   ```

4. **Viewing Saved Jokes**:  
   Loop through the dictionary and print each joke in a user-friendly format:  
   ```python
   for joke_id, joke_content in saved_jokes.items():
       print(f"ID: {joke_id}, Joke: {joke_content}")
   ```

---

## üéâ **What You‚Äôll Learn**  

By completing this challenge, you‚Äôll strengthen your understanding of:  

- **APIs**: Fetching and working with data from APIs.  
- **Data Storage**: Using Python dictionaries to manage and display saved data.  
- **User Interaction**: Building an interactive command-line program.  
- **Error Handling**: Managing invalid user inputs gracefully.
