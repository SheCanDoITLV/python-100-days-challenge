# üëâ Day 83 Challenge: Custom Themes for Your Blog! üé®üñåÔ∏è

Today‚Äôs challenge is all about adding a splash of style to your blog! We‚Äôre going to implement custom themes, so users can personalize their experience. Ready to get creative? Let‚Äôs go! üöÄ

### üìù Challenge Instructions

1. **Retrieve Your Blog Code from Day 77**  
   - Start by grabbing the code you wrote on Day 77, including your HTML template file.

2. **Set Up Theme Customization**  
   - Use `GET` requests to detect a `theme` variable. When a theme name is passed in the URL, your app should apply that specific theme to the blog page.

3. **Create Multiple Themes**  
   - Design at least **two visually distinct themes**:
     - Each theme should differ in at least one primary color.
     - Feel free to get creative ‚Äî experiment with fonts, layouts, or backgrounds if you're inspired!

4. **Default Theme**  
   - If no `theme` variable is provided, the blog should load a **default theme**.

### ‚ú® Pro Tip: Personalize It!
Give each theme a unique vibe! Perhaps one theme is calming and professional, while the other is bold and playful. The goal is to make your blog feel customizable and engaging. üåà

Enjoy adding a touch of customization to your blog, and see how each theme changes the feel of your content!
